# üß† n8n-nodes-function

Blueprint-style function system for [n8n](https://n8n.io), inspired by Unreal Engine 5.

Define reusable logic blocks with [`Function`](./nodes/Function), call them with [`CallFunction`](./nodes/CallFunction), and return values with [`ReturnFromFunction`](./nodes/ReturnFromFunction).

## üì¶ Features

- üß± **Define reusable logic** with named [`Function`](./nodes/Function/Function.node.ts) nodes
- üìû **Call functions** with dynamic parameters using [`CallFunction`](./nodes/CallFunction/CallFunction.node.ts)
- üîÅ **Return values cleanly** using [`ReturnFromFunction`](./nodes/ReturnFromFunction/ReturnFromFunction.node.ts)
- üß¨ **Nested function calls** - functions can call other functions with isolated return values
- üåç **Global functions** - share logic across workflows

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Gotchas

> üëã Hey `n8n` team devs, feel free to steal the ideas here and build this into `n8n`.
> 
> If `n8n` had built-in support for functions, we could fix some of these limitations.

- üü¢ Functions only work on `Active` workflows.

- üîÉ To detect changes to new/existing `Function` nodes, toggle the workflow off/on.
  > _The `Call Function` and `Return from Function` do not require toggle workflow after changes._  
  > _But function names/params from `Function` nodes require toggling the active state._  
  > _It's not an intentional choice, it's just a limitation of how trigger nodes work in `n8n`._

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Functions appear as separate `Executions`.
  > _Again, this is not an intentional choice, it's just how `n8n` works with trigger nodes._
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Queue mode (_currently unsupported_)
  > At the moment, these nodes do not support `n8n` running in queue mode.
  >
  > I might add it later, because I only found out because my own servers run in queue mode, soooo... bummer!
  > 
  > I just need to move the Function Registry someplace, e.g. Redis
