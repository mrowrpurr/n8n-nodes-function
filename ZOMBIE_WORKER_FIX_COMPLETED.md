# Zombie Worker Fix Implementation - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive zombie worker cleanup to prevent accumulation of stale workers that cause CallFunction timeouts. The fix includes both proactive cleanup during Function node lifecycle and a debug utility for manual cleanup during testing.

## Problem Analysis
From `STILL-wont-run-after-save.log`, the issue was:
1. **Zombie Worker Accumulation**: Old workers from previous runs (`Test Fn-CmaJH8LPpTrXUENt-1750259861096-0ft2xqez0`, `Test Fn-CmaJH8LPpTrXUENt-1750259869165-5x80xv4tj`) remained in Redis registry
2. **All Workers Unhealthy**: CallFunction found only stale workers, causing 10-second timeout
3. **Function Node Not Restarting**: After `closeFunction`, no new Function node started up

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Function Node Cleanup (`nodes/Function/Function.node.ts`)

#### A. Startup Zombie Cleanup
Added proactive cleanup when Function node starts:
```typescript
// Clean up any zombie workers from previous runs before starting
try {
    const registry = await getEnhancedFunctionRegistry()
    const cleanedCount = await registry.cleanupStaleWorkers(functionName)
    if (cleanedCount > 0) {
        logger.log(`🚀 FUNCTION: ✅ Cleaned up ${cleanedCount} zombie workers on startup`)
    }
} catch (error) {
    logger.warn("🚀 FUNCTION: ⚠️ Failed to clean up zombie workers on startup:", error)
    // Don't fail startup if cleanup fails
}
```

#### B. Enhanced Shutdown Cleanup
Modified `closeFunction` to clean up ALL stale workers, not just current worker:
```typescript
// Enhanced zombie worker cleanup - clean up ALL stale workers for this function
// This prevents accumulation of zombie workers from previous runs
if (registry) {
    try {
        const cleanedCount = await registry.cleanupStaleWorkers(functionName)
        if (cleanedCount > 0) {
            logger.log(`🚀 FUNCTION: ✅ Cleaned up ${cleanedCount} zombie workers during shutdown`)
        }
    } catch (cleanupError) {
        logger.warn("🚀 FUNCTION: ⚠️ Failed to clean up zombie workers:", cleanupError)
    }

    // Clean up current worker registration to prevent zombie workers
    if (workerId) {
        await registry.unregisterWorker(workerId, functionName)
        logger.log("🚀 FUNCTION: ✅ Current worker unregistered to prevent zombie workers")
    }
}
```

### 2. Debug Utility Node (`nodes/RedisCleanup/RedisCleanup.node.ts`)

Created a comprehensive debug utility for manual Redis cleanup during testing:

#### Features:
- **Stale Workers Only** (Safe): Removes only unhealthy workers (>30s old)
- **Specific Function Workers**: Removes all workers for a specific function
- **All Function Workers**: Removes all worker registrations
- **Nuclear Option**: Removes ALL function-related Redis keys

#### Safety Features:
- Requires explicit confirmation checkbox
- Clear warnings that it's DEBUG ONLY
- Detailed logging of what was cleaned
- Returns cleanup statistics

#### Usage:
1. Add "Redis Cleanup" node to workflow
2. Select cleanup type (recommend "Stale Workers Only")
3. Check "Confirm Cleanup" checkbox
4. Execute to clean up zombie workers

## Technical Details

### Zombie Worker Prevention Strategy
1. **Proactive Cleanup**: Clean stale workers on Function node startup
2. **Comprehensive Shutdown**: Clean ALL stale workers during closeFunction
3. **Manual Recovery**: Debug utility for testing scenarios

### Registry Methods Used
- `registry.cleanupStaleWorkers(functionName)`: Removes workers older than 30 seconds
- `registry.unregisterWorker(workerId, functionName)`: Removes specific worker
- Redis key patterns: `n8n-nodes-function:workers:*` and `n8n-nodes-function:worker:*`

### Logging Enhancements
- Clear logging of zombie cleanup operations
- Counts of cleaned workers
- Warnings for cleanup failures (non-blocking)

## Build Status
✅ **PASSED**: `pnpm build` completes successfully with no TypeScript errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Function Node Lifecycle
1. **Startup**: Automatically cleans up any zombie workers from previous runs
2. **Operation**: Maintains healthy worker registration with periodic health updates
3. **Shutdown**: Cleans up ALL stale workers + current worker, ready for restart
4. **Restart**: n8n should call `trigger()` again, starting fresh with clean registry

### CallFunction Behavior
1. **Immediate Availability**: Should find healthy workers instantly (no 10s timeout)
2. **No Zombie Workers**: Registry should only contain healthy, active workers
3. **Reliable Execution**: Function calls should complete successfully

### Debug Workflow
1. **Manual Cleanup**: Use Redis Cleanup node to clear stale workers during testing
2. **Safe Recovery**: "Stale Workers Only" option provides safe cleanup
3. **Nuclear Option**: Complete Redis reset available if needed

## Files Modified
- `nodes/Function/Function.node.ts`: Enhanced zombie cleanup in startup and shutdown
- `nodes/RedisCleanup/RedisCleanup.node.ts`: New debug utility node (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)

## Next Steps
1. **Test the Fix**: Create workflow with Function node, add CallFunction, verify no timeouts
2. **Verify Restart**: Ensure Function nodes restart properly after workflow saves
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for zombie cleanup messages in logs
4. **Use Debug Node**: Test Redis Cleanup utility for manual cleanup during development

The zombie worker accumulation issue should now be resolved with comprehensive cleanup at both startup and shutdown, plus manual recovery tools for testing scenarios.
